				<h3>About SIVANANDA YOGA VENDATA CENTRES

					The Sivananda Yoga Vendata Centres,  non profit organisation, was founded by Sri Swami Vishnudevananda in 1957. He was initiated and trained by his Master, Swami Sivananda, founder, Divine Life Society, Rishikesh, Himalayas to spread the ideals of Yoga and Vedanta.


By closely observing the lifestyles and needs of people, Swami Vishnudevananda synthesised the ancient wisdom of Yoga into five basic principles that could easily be incorporated into one's own lifestyle to provide the foundation for healthy living. It is around these five principles that the activities at the Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centre are based.</p>
